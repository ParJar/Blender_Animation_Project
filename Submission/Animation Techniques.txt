The new modifiers used in this project was the use of the mirror, edge split and simple deform modifiers. The 
edge split modifier was used to smooth the surface of the car appropriately after applying smooth shading. The mirror
modifier helped create the tunnel and car as only half of the objects would need to be modelled. The simple deform modifier
was used to bend the tunnel and all objects within it.
Furthermore, smoke domains were used with particle emitters to use as exhaust smoke. This also allowed for the particle
effects to be baked into the blender project. Some materials also included shaders which used mix shaders, textures and
colour ramp nodes to enhance the final material.
To make animating the car easier, drivers were used to link rotation of the wheels to an empty which was paired with the
vehicle. Markers were required in animation to allow for camera switching and multiple scenes.
